Just playing around with some logic and basic mathematics.

# Usages

To use these files, they should be ran in the terminal since the outputs on these are just 1-liners and don't produce anything substantial.

For the `temp.php` file, you have 2 options.
```
$temp->toCelsius(); // Converts the Fahrenheit number to Celsius
$temp->toFahrenheit(); // Converts the Celsius number to Fahrenheit
```

You also have the ability to input the string variation as well.

```
$temp->toFahrenheit('21.11°C'); // Converts the Celsius number to 70°F
```

For the `height.php` file, you also have 2 options.
```
$height->toFeetInch(); // Converts centimeters to feet and inches
$height->toCm(); // Converts feet and inches to centimeters
```

You also have the ability to input the string variation as well.

```
$height->toCm('5\'7"'); // Converts the height from feet and inches to centimeters
```
